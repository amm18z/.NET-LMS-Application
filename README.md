Learning management system console application (similar to Canvas).

C+P assignment description from Canvas:
This semester, you will be building a Learning Management System (LMS) similar to Canvas. Note that the requirements for the project are intentionally vague and the expectation is that most projects will have significant variation in the way that they are implemented and their user experience. The data requirements for the first project are that you must have the following classes:

The functional requirements are that an end user must be able to:

Create a course and add it to a list of courses
Create a student and add it to a list of students
Add a student from the list of students to a specific course
Remove a student from a course’s roster
List all courses
Search for courses by name or description
List all students
Search for a student by name
List all courses a student is taking
Update a course’s information
Update a student’s information
Create an assignment and add it to the list of assignments for a course
When selected from a list or search results, a course should show all its information. Only the course code and name should show in the lists.
Note that you may add any additional properties/functionality you would like. These requirements serve as the minimum specifications. Finally, note that in addition to your complete Visual Studio project you MUST also supply a short video demonstrating the functionality outlined in bullets 1-13 above. The video MUST demonstrate your understanding of the code as well as the requirement functioning.
